Maybe because it was missing a built-in joystick port - you had to buy and plug an adapter. Maybe it was for the rubber keys with all the available BASIC statements printed on it as it was admitting that \"That's all I can do, man\".",
            "Or, more sincerely, It was for its cheap beeper, the primitive graphics, the color clash, the slow pace of his games.",

This way it can run some ZX Spectrum 48k BASIC games... but often with some compromises - or artistic choices, if you prefer.",
            "Some games may be limited, some others may display some glitches, and some may not run at all.",
            "The best way to experience these games as they were meant is using a ZX Spectrum 48k emulator or, obviously, on the original hardware."

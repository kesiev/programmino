            "The last weeks of December 2021, and for some days in a row, I've dreamt of floating chunks of unrecognizable code, unreadable walls of text, and pulsating lo-res graphics coming from computers and languages I've used in my past.",
            "In the morning I was used to wondering what kind of machine could be able to do that. One day, as a challenge, I decided to attempt an implementation.",
            "The code of that dreams was a twisted mix of old and new languages. I needed an interpreter able, to some extent, to understand multiple syntaxes at the same time. Languages and standards changed a lot over the years and many of them are not compatible with each other. I had to make several compromises.",
            "Moreover, the graphics weren't coming from a single exact machine: there were Commodore 64 sprites but with wrong and yet familiar color palettes, stretched ZX Spectrum UDGs, and so on. I needed something able to recreate that mess putting together stuff from different machines. Emulation wasn't an option, so I decided to simulate different features of these machines in a way I could run them together.",
            "Programmino is the code interpreter and infrastructure that ties everything together: each element, such as a palette, a sprite engine, a font, or an interpreter configuration is contained in a package and multiple packages can be used together regardless of where they came from. The result is something like a Fantasy Computer - or Fantasy Console if you prefer - but Programmino is only a means to achieve my goal.",
            "Then I implemented the features I could remember from dreams, splitting them into single packages. I tried my best to make order in that nonsense and to get inspiration from the original hardware and programs.",
            "To recreate that \"dreamy\" feeling, I selected some of the packages that made sense together and grouped them into the <span class='code'>dream-kesiev</span> meta-package, that's the one Programmino uses by default.",
            "Finally, I've written a few working programs that resemble the ones I've seen in that dreams: irregular, wrong, and yet familiar.",
            "This magazine collects my work so far.",
            "Thank you so much for reading and have fun. And please, don't learn how to code from this magazine - these programs are coming from fever dreams."

            "But there is another side of this glorious \"previous &amp; now\" story: introducing the Commodore 64 BASIC programmers and their endless challenge. Their programs were published in books and magazines and needed to be typed in by hand at least once but with the promise of furious shootings, space adventures, and thrilling bets. A promise rarely kept - to tell the truth - due to the machine's slow interpreter.",
            "There should be no reason nowadays to keep coding games this way - the new tools are helping a lot in leaving BASIC behind and typing-in code is just a painful reminder of the past.",

This way it can run some Commodore 64 BASIC games... but often with some compromises - or artistic choices, if you prefer.",
            "Some games may be limited, some others may display some glitches, and some may not run at all.",

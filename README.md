**Programmino** is an experimental Fantasy Computer that **simulates multiple features from different real-life retro computers and coding styles/syntaxes from different languages at the same time**. Features can be picked and mixed by single programs, so valid Programmino programs may look like tidy and coherent regular code, obscure blocks of abbreviations, or crazy irregular pastiches of clashing stuff from different standards and machines. The same may happen when executed - you decide. **It tries to implement a dream** of floating chunks of unrecognizable code, unreadable walls of text, and pulsating lo-res graphics I had in the last weeks of December 2021.

# Programmino

## TODO

I'm leaving here some end-project notes. I don't think to work on Programmino a lot more but... just in case.

  * More BASIC statements
  * Better memory management (Do not create constant tokens, etc.)
  * More accurate C64 features (Cursor color after INPUT statements, etc.)
  * Better code execution (C64 10LINES ADV displays asterisks that aren't there, etc.)
  * Better comments parser (via startRawMode like DATA statements?)
  * More simulated memory areas
  * More examples
